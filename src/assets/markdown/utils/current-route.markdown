## Implementing the CurrentRoute Class for Angular Routing

The `CurrentRoute` class is a utility designed to simplify the process of obtaining the current active route in an Angular application. It captures the latest route navigated to and provides easy access to its snapshot. This chapter guides you through the setup and usage of the `CurrentRoute` class.

### Setup and Integration

Begin by importing necessary Angular routing modules and the `CurrentRoute` class:

```typescript
import { ActivatedRoute, Router } from "@angular/router";
import { CurrentRoute } from "./path/to/currentroute";
```

Instantiate `CurrentRoute` in your component or service. This class does not require any parameters for its constructor:

```typescript
let currentRoute = new CurrentRoute();
```

### Capturing the Current Route

Upon instantiation, `CurrentRoute` begins listening to navigation events in the application. When the navigation ends, it updates its internal state with the most recently activated route.

This is handled automatically within the class, requiring no additional setup from the developer.

### Accessing Route Data

To access the current route's snapshot, use the `snapshot` getter provided by the `CurrentRoute` class:

```typescript
let routeSnapshot = currentRoute.snapshot;
```

The `snapshot` contains valuable information about the current route, such as URL parameters, query parameters, and route data.

### Example Use Case

A common use case for `CurrentRoute` is to obtain URL parameters or query parameters in components that are not directly linked to a route but still need access to this information.

For example, in a service or a nested component, you might need to access the user ID from the URL:

```typescript
let userId = currentRoute.snapshot?.paramMap.get('userId');
```
